# StreamingServiceFrontend

This is a Netflix-style movie/TV streaming UI built using React and powered by TMDB APIs, with a custom backend for recommendations, search, and server-side rendering optimizations.

The app mimics a modern OTT experience â€” with banners, carousels, search, genre exploration, and (in progress) watchlist & recommendation features.


Features

Dynamic landing page with banner & multiple recommendation rows

Search movies/TV shows in real-time

Planning to add collaborative filtering for personalised reccomendations currently deployed for only data collection from users

Server-side optimized API fetches (no direct TMDB calls in frontend)

(Planned) Authentication + Watchlist persistence
